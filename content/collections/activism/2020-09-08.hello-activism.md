        text: 'My journey to calling myself an activist has been a long and rambling one. When I first came out as a lesbian my senior year in high school, I didn''t want that fact to drastically change my life. I still wanted to wear a dress at my wedding, I still wanted to have a stereotypical wedding and lead a similar life to the one my parents lead. In short I wanted to lead my life as a ''happens-to-be-gay''.'
